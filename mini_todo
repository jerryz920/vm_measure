1. purpose
	1.) find out the degree of associative of cache
	2.) construct a walk sequence that remain in cache, but will consume all TLB. Measure the total cost of the walk
	3.) if the avg cost is a lot different, then stop probing
	4.) use perf/cpuid to confirm this

2. purpose
	1.) measure the cost to TLB miss, and zero out a page, turn off swap
	2.) mmap a anonymous file of size N * L-2 TLB size
		walk through once and invalid everything
		then measure the cost to walk the second time
		repeat with step 2.) and compare the time
	3.) check if madvice can improve the time
	4.) optional (make system with few free pages, and try to see if the time is still the same)

3. purpose
	1.) compare the cost to walk through a big page/small page

4. purpose
	1.) compile apache and measure the code size
	2.) construct a simulating walk sequence on different copy of the code to see the overhead
	3.) compare the cost of simulating shared object vs statis object
