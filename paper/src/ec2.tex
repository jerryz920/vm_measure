\subsection{Platform Description}
    \label{subsec:ec2}
    Our tests use the new HPC-oriented Amazon EC2 Cluster Compute Instances
    (CCIs) available since July 2010. Each CCI has 2 quad-core Intel Xeon
    X5570 "Nehalem" processors, with 23GB of memory. Each instance is
    allocated to users in a dedicated manner, unlike those in most other EC2
    instance classes \cite{amazon:hpc}. The CCIs are interconnected with 10
    Gigabit Ethernet. Due to the unstable availability of EBS storage that we
    recently encountered, all our experiments in this section use the
    ephemeral disks. 

    Regarding software settings, we use the Cluster Instances Amazon Linux AMI
    $2011.02.1$ associated with CCIs, the Intel compiler $11.1.072$ and Intel
    MPI $4.0.1$. The default compiler optimization level is \emph{$-O3$}.
