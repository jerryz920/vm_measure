	Abstract = {The complexity of HPC systems has increased the burden on the developer as applications scale to hundreds of thousands of processing cores. I/O processing is one area where extensive efforts are required to achieve acceptable performance and scalability. 

A successful approach to high performance I/O demonstrated by our group and others is to use select nodes for data staging, where data is evacuated from compute to staging nodes before being moved to the disk via the file system. This paper shows that I/O performance can be improved substantially by carefully managing how data staging is performed, and by enriching such I/O actions through additional "data services", lightweight abstractions for carrying out data processing such as transformation, reduction and scheduled storage. We evaluate data services on actual application codes within our data staging framework for asynchronous data movement, and we also describe the impact of resource management in synchronous environments.

	Abstract = {Dataset storage, exchange, and access play a critical role in
  scientific applications. For such purposes netCDF serves as a portable,
  efficient file format and programming interface, which is popular in numerous
  scientific application domains. However, the original interface does not
  provide an efficient mechanism for parallel data storage and access. \par In
  this work, we present a new parallel interface for writing and reading netCDF
  datasets. This interface is derived with minimal changes from the serial
  netCDF interface but defines semantics for parallel access and is tailored
  for high performance. The underlying parallel I/O is achieved through MPI-IO,
  allowing for substantial performance gains through the use of collective I/O
  optimizations. We compare the implementation strategies and performance with
  HDF5. Our tests indicate programming convenience and significant I/O
  performance improvement with this parallel netCDF (PnetCDF) interface.},
