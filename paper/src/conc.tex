\section{Conclusion}
    \label{sec:conclusion}
    In this paper, we demonstrate that the unique configurability advantage
    offered by public clouds may bring opportunities for HPC applications to
    achieve significant performance or cost improvement. In particular, we
    illustrate the impact of virtual cluster configurability by assessing the
    impact of I/O system customization on the Amazon EC2 system. Our results
    indicate that for I/O-intensive applications, cloud-based clusters enable
    users to build per-application parallel file systems, where no
    one-size-fits-all parallel I/O solution can satisfy the needs of all
    applications. In the future, we will try to explore how the storage
    options interact with the characteristics of HPC applications and finally
    to automate the process of choosing I/O storage options for an individual
    application.
