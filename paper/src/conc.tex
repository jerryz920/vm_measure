\section{Conclusion}
    \label{sec:conc}
   In this work I mainly finished four parts of experiments, to explore the
   details of virtual memory subsystem. Total code lines are quite small, 2000
   lines C and inline assembly in total with comment. The code, the experiment
   raw data, and also the tex source, could be downloaded from ~\cite{github}.
   The results and conclusions from each part basically confirms my knowledge
   about how things are working. There is still some parts that can not be
   explained well, and I will seek to find the answer in the future.

\section{Acknowledgement}
    \label{sec:ack}
   Thanks to everyone that helps me on my project, especially the instructor Michael Swift, he hints me the problem of out of order execution in measuring TLB size, and it does help to get the final result.
