   Virtual memory is one of the most important subsystems inside modern operating
   systems. Although it is transparent to users, understanding the virtual memory
   can help to build better applications, especially in performance improvement.
   In this paper, I come to four issues of virtual memory: TLB, User space
   allocator, huge pages, and optimization of code sharing. I use performance
   measurement to explore deeply how these parts are working underlying our
   benchmarks. Most of the experiments run as I expect, except the TLB part. I will
   explain further in the paper about the methods, the results, and the conclustions
   on each separate parts. Moreover, I will try to illustrate why TLB measurement
   does not work well.

%  In this paper, we find that for BTIO, through tuning the I/O configuration
%  the application performance can be improved 30\% than the default NFS
%  configuration without increasing any extra cost. As the number of I/O servers
%  of the parallel file system increases, the application performance can be
%  improved continuously.
