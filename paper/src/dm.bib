  sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the
  extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating
  gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at
  approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a
  method is introduced for automatically combining statistically
  significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific
  score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The
  resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs
  at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but
  in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically
  relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several

  can very often produce sub-optimal query execution plans, leading to

  databases used for complex decision support queries and/or

  that detects sub-optimality of a query execution plan during query
  execution and attempts to correct the problem. The basic idea is to
  collect statistics at key points during the execution of a complex
  query. These statistics are then used to optimize the execution of
  the query, either by improving the resource allocation for that
  query, or by changing the execution plan for the remainder of the
  query. To ensure that this does not significantly slow down the
  normal execution of a query, the Query Optimizer carefully chooses
  what statistics to collect, when to collect them, and the
  circumstances under which to re-optimize the query. We describe an
  implementation of this algorithm in the Paradise Database System,
  and we report on performance studies, which indicate that this can
  result in significant improvements in the performance of complex
  queries.",

  abstract = "BLAST is an important tool in bioinformatics. It has
  been used to find biologically similar sequences to the given query
  sequence from the database of the annotated sequences. For high
  throughput processing of huge number of query sequences, there have
  been many studies on parallel batch processing of sequence
  similarity search using BLAST. As the number of sequences in the
  database increases at exponential rate, the search speed of BLAST
  itself becomes important. Although NCBI has developed a parallel
  BLAST using the thread on SMP machines for the speedup of BLAST, the
  speedup is still limited because the SMP machine has restricted the
  number of processors due to its architecture. In this paper, we
  present our parallelized BLAST on cluster systems for further
  speedup. The main strategy used is the exploitation of the
  inter-node parallelism, which can be extracted by logical
  partitioning of the database. For the inter-node parallelism, we
  have designed and implemented a logical database partitioning
  method, initiation and coordination of the BLAST on remote node and
  communication protocol for collecting remote node's
  result. According to our performance test with 2-way 8 node cluster
  system, roughly 12 times speedup has been achieved in terms of
  response time of similarity search for individual query sequence.",
