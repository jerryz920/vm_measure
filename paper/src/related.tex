\section{Related Work}
    \label{sec:related}
    Recently, there have been a series of research efforts focusing on the
    performance of using public clouds for high performance computing. Most of
    previous work are focusing on computation and communication behavior
    running on clouds. Very little work has investigated I/O and storage
    issues in virtualized or cloud environments. Some of them focused on
    long-term storage or inter-job or inter-task data flow. For example, Juve
    et al. studied the performance and cost of different storage options for
    scientific workflows running on Amazon EC2~\cite{juve:workflow-io}.
    Palankar et al. assessed the feasibility of using Amazon S3 for scientific
    grid computing~\cite{palankar:s3}. Abe et al. constructed pWalrus, which
    provides S3-like storage access on top of the PVFS parallel file system on
    an open-source cloud~\cite{abe:pfs-cloud}. Yu and Vetter studied parallel
    I/O in Xen-based HPC, but the environment used only have virtualized
    compute nodes and the authors only tested at most 16
    processes~\cite{yu:xen-hpc}. To our best knowledge, our work is the first
    to evaluate different parallel/shared file system settings for parallel
    I/O on public clouds.
