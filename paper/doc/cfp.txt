The 2nd ACM SIGOPS Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems (APSys 2011) will be held in Shanghai on July 11th and 12th, 2011. It will be a forum for systems researchers and practitioners across the world to present their work in computer systems (broadly defined) and for locals in Asian/Pacific region to meet, interact, and collaborate with top researchers in the field. APSys 2011 takes a broad view of systems and solicits papers from various fields of systems, including but not limited to:

 * Operating systems
 * Manycore/multicore computing and programming
 * File and storage systems, flash-based storage systems
 * Distributed systems and networks
 * Systems for the emerging world
 * Mobile, embedded, and personal devices
 * Cloud computing, data center issues, software as a service
 * Energy efficiency in computer systems
 * System performance measurement, monitoring, analysis, debugging, and diagnostics
 * Virtualized systems
 * Reliability, scalability, and fault-tolerance
 * Security
 * Formal methods
 * Support for emerging applications(medical, social network, etc)

We are open to position or experience papers of five or fewer pages that propose new directions of research, report on noteworthy actual experience, or will generate lively discussion around important system topics.

Authors are allowed and even encouraged to extend their position papers to publish them at other top systems conferences. Authors are also allowed to present experience papers on work that has been already published elsewhere but with new perspectives and additional results. Papers will be selected based on their originality, technical merit, clarity, relevance, and likelihood of leading to insightful technical discussions that will influence future systems research.

Papers published at APSys will be collected into the ACM digital library.
