        \par
        My university would like to hold the original receipts 'cause I was
        supported by our university as well. The total cost is about \$500 and
        Tsinghua University covers \$200 of it. I'm glad to be supported by
        the ACM student travel grant.

        \par
        The receipts are in Chinese, but you can find the internel English translation
        for each line. There is no intrinsic translation for my railway
        ticket. I noted them in the blank. I hope this helps.

        \par
        Thank you very much for your consideration.

        \closing{Yours sincerely,\\ Yan Zhai}
